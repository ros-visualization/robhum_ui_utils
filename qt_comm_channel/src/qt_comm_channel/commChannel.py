class CommChannel(QObject):
    '''
    Combines Qt signals into one place. Avoids error "... has no method 'emit'". 
    This is a static class. Usage:
       - Subclass this class; without creating any methods, including __init__().
       - The only active part in the subclass is to define Qt signals. Example::
       
             class MySignals(CommChannel):
                quitSig      = QtCore.Signal(QPushButton)
                taskDoneSig  = QtCore.Signal()
                
       - Before using the signals in your application, call registerSignals on CommChannel,
         passing your subclass::
         
             CommChannel.registerSignals(MySignals)
             
       - After that call, access your signals like this::
        
            CommChannel.getSignal('MySignals.quitSig')
            
         Note that the signal ID is a string consisting of the name
         of your subclass, followed by a dot, followed by the 
         signal class attribute's name.
         
       - Other modules in the same application can access the signals the same way.
